# Intro

This repo demonstrates a simple-page that enables a map to be easily annotated - using simple drawing tools - saved, and shared.    

The repo uses `Mapbox GL JS` for the base map,  `Mapbox GL Draw` to enable the drawing and to generate the `GeoJSON` and `Github Gist` for saving and sharing the `GeoJSON`.  


# Demo
