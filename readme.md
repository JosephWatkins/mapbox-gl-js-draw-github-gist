# Intro

This repo demonstrates a simple-page that enables a map to be easily annotated - using simple drawing tools - saved, and shared.    

The repo uses `Mapbox GL JS` for the base map,  `Mapbox GL Draw` to enable the drawing and to generate the `GeoJSON` and `Github Gist` for saving and sharing the `GeoJSON`.  


# Demo

Ever wanted to see a map of the [Parliamentary Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Triangle,_Canberra) of Canberra, Australia?  Of course you have.  Let me draw that for you.
